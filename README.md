This repository contains the code I wrote to finish [a LinkedIn Course](linkedin.com/learning/rust-code-challenges). This course provides 17 challenges in Rust of 4 difficulty levels. The only challenge I did not do was challenge 15 because the question was too vague for me to answer.

## Motivation

I did this LinkedIn course because I wanted to get better at Rust through completing hands-on code challenges.

## Testing

All the challenges contain tests to validate that the output is correct. To run these tests, run the command

```
$ cargo test
```
